BC German Club
===
Use `npm install` to install dependencies (node_modules), then `npm start` to start [browser-sync](https://browsersync.io/) and sync changes to the browser and devices.

Notice
---
The founder, [Noah](https://github.com/NoahBerry1), has graduated from the college and moved on. As of Fall 2016, the German Club has disbanded. I am keeping the website up online for now, but redacted contact fields and events. If someone wants to take over the club, let me or Noah know. I can transfer ownership of the site or stay as web admin.

TODO
---
- Migrate from Parse to MongoDB ([Parse has unfortunately retired](http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/))
